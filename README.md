# Project-5: Daily Diary

## Description
This project is a Daily Diary application built using Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to write daily notes and save them to a text file with timestamps for future reference. The application is simple, efficient, and perfect for journaling.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure the following modules are installed:

- **Tkinter**: Included by default in most Python installations.
- **Time**: A standard Python library, included by default.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

2. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python project-5.py
    ```

3. The Diary GUI window will open. You can:
   - Type your daily notes in the text area.
   - Click the "Save" button to save the diary entry.
   - Each entry will be saved in a file named `daily_diary.txt` with a timestamp.

## Features
- **Text Entry**: Provides a text area for journaling.
- **Save Functionality**: Saves diary entries with a timestamp to a `.txt` file.
- **User Feedback**: Displays success and warning messages for user actions.

## Limitations
